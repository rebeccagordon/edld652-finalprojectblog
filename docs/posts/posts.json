These patterns are similar for both types of local revenue (total and from property taxes). States in the Northeast have the highest average total local revenue and local revenue from property taxes. Overall, states in the South have the lowest average local revenue. States in the Midwest are in the middle, and states in the West are distributed across the range.\nDistricts in some states receive $0 in local revenue from property taxes (e.g., Connecticut).\nThese same regional patterns are not observed when examining the average percent proficient on RLA assessments for all students (grades 3 to high school). However, it does appear that states in the South have lower average percentages of students at or above proficient on reading assessments compared to states in other regions.\nPrior Versions\n\n\nPrior Version 1\n\n\n\nPrior Version 2\n\n\n\nPrior Version 3\n\n\n\nPrior Version 4\n\n\n\nPrior Version 5\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution of plots over time:\nAs all three plots are similar in regard to format and design choices and went through a very similar (if not the exact same) evolution, I’ve included the previous versions of just one plot above.\nPrior Version 1 is my first attempt at this plot.

This version uses the default color palette.\nPrior Version 4 includes my selection of a final color palette (from a Wes Anderson package), improvements to the color legend, and addition of a vertical reference line.\nPrior Version 5 demonstrates that I evaluated the color palette for different types of color blindness.\nBetween Prior Version 4 and the final version, I simplified the x-axis breaks even more, made the range and breaks of the x-axis the same between revenue plots (in order to facilitate comparison), and further reduced the transparency of the bars.\n\n\n\n",

Compared to the bar plots, it is a bit more difficult to make precise comparisons between average revenue.\nHowever, the maps are striking and are effective at communicating drastic differences between states (e.g., the Northeast, Nevada).\nWhat is also easier to observe on the maps in comparison to the bar plots is differences between average district local revenue and local revenue from property taxes. For example, Connecticut has the highest total local revenue but no revenue from property taxes. This is easier to see when pivoting between maps than between bar plots.\nPrior Versions\n\n\nPrior Version 1\n\n\n\nPrior Version 2\n\n\n\nPrior Version 3\n\n\n\nPrior Version 4\n\n\n\nPrior Version 5\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution of plots over time:\nAs both plots are similar in regard to format and design choices and went through the same evolution, I’ve included the previous versions of just one plot above.\nPrior Version 1 is my first attempt at this plot. I used the viridis magma palette. I had not yet figured out how to fill the missing states and had only made some refinements (title, caption, background).\nIn Prior Version 2, I had figured out how to fill states with missing data but the fill color is the default gray. I had also made initial refinements to the color legend.\nPrior Version 3 shows one of my first attempts at exploring different color palettes. I like viridis magma and thought it worked well, but I wanted a more subdued color palette to be cohesive with the color palette I had chosen for the bar plots. Prior Version 3 also includes a discretized color legend. The issue is that not all colors on the map were represented in the legend. I tried problem-solving but eventually opted to move on.\nPrior Version 4 includes my selection of a final color palette. I had initially thought I would use the scale as displayed (light to dark). After coming back to this project with fresh eyes, I decided to go with dark to light and to change the state borders to a darker color to distinguish perimeter states from the white background.\nPrior Version 5 is exploring the use of a divergent color palette. I think the diverging color palette is compelling but communicates a different message (most states have district local revenue near or below the national average instead of overall, states in Northeast have the highest average district local revenue).\n\n\n\n",

The percentage of students who are Hispanic/Latino who are at/above proficient is lowest. There appears to be a positive relationship between district revenue from property taxes and the percent of students attaining proficiency on reading assessments for all student subgroups. Overall, the effect of revenue appears similar across subgroups but is perhaps somewhat stronger for students reported as Asian/Pacific Islander and weaker in strength for students reported as American Indian/Alaska Native.\nMichigan: Overall, the percentages of White and Asian/Pacific Islander students scoring at/above proficient on reading assessments are higher than other subgroups. The percentage of students at/above proficient who are Black is lowest. The fitted lines for White, Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian/Alaska Native subgroups have slight positive slopes, indicating that percent proficiency for these subgroups does not increase based on an increase in funding from property taxes. The fitted lines for Black and Asian/Pacific Islander subgroups are steeper, indicating a stronger association.\nLouisiana: Overall, the percentage Asian/Pacific Islander students scoring at/above proficient on reading assessments is higher than other subgroups. The percentage of students at/above proficient who are Black is lowest. There appears to be a moderate positive association between property tax revenue for all student subgroups except students reported as American Indian/Alaska Native. It appears that the percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students scoring at or above proficient on reading assessments does not increase as funding from property taxes increases.\nNew Jersey: Overall, the percentage Asian/Pacific Islander students scoring at/above proficient on reading assessments is higher than other subgroups. The percentage of students at/above proficient who are Black is lowest. There appears to be a strong relationship in funding from property taxes and student proficiency in reading for all subgroups except American Indian/Alaska Native students. The association between funding and proficiency for American Indian/Alaska Native students appears to be strongly negative. I did not get to this, but it would be worth examining the number of districts that reported proficiency data for this subgroup compared to other subgroups.\nPrior Versions\n\n\nPrior Version 1\n\n\n\nPrior Version 2\n\n\n\nPrior Version 3\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution of plots over time:\nPrior Version 1 is a broad preliminary exploratory visualization across all states. I fitted linear regressions lines to student subgroups, including race/ethnicity, English Learners, students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged students, and students overall.\nFrom the broad exploration, I narrowed the scope to one state from each US Census region. Prior Version 2 displays the relationship between district revenue from property taxes and outcomes of student race/ethnicity subgroups for districts in the state of California. I tried a different Wes Anderson palette.\nUnlike the color palette I used for the bar plots, this color palette was not colorblind-friendly (Prior Version 3). The palette from the bar plots didn’t have enough colors for these plots.\nSo, between this version and the final version, I shifted to using the Okabe Ito palette. I also adjusted the color and transparency of the scatterplot points, removed the outlines from the points, and refined the color legend.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKsenia\nResearch Question:\nHow much is spent total on a single student yearly and how do these amounts vary by state?\nTo illustrate the total expenditure per state, I decided to look at spending per single student. The raw amounts of total spending don’t give us a full picture, because states vary by population size and the number of students enrolled in high schools. Thus, looking at the expenditure per single student allows for a more comparable information.\nDesign choices:\nUsing a color-blind friendly OkabeIto pallette.\nMapping regions to color to add the extra dimension for comparison.\nCreating a vertical bar to show the national average of the total spending per student, which allows to easily see which states’ spending is above and below average.\nBalancing the cognitive load by excluding unnecessary components: the title of the Y-axes, horizontal grids, embedded value of the total spending on each bar.\nThe first plot reflects the total spending per single student by state, while the second plot illustrates the total spending per single student grouped by the region: :\n\n\n\n\n\nPlots\n\n\n\nFindings:\nDistrict of Columbia spent the most total on a single student ($25,613), followed by New York ($21,770) and Vermont ($19,541). All Northeastern states are in the top 15 states with highest spending per student, which is reflected in the plot below demonstrating that in Northeastern states, an average spending per single students is the highest and equals $17,194. The first plot also reveals that in every single in the Northeast regions the total spending per student exceeds the national average.\nThe three states with the lowest spending per students are Idaho ($7,798), Utah ($8,040), and Arizona ($8,999), which are all Western States. Compared to other regions, a Western state spends the least per student on average ($11,745). It can be observed that all Western states except Wyoming and Alaska spend less on a single student that the national mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior version 1\n\n\n\nThe very first attempt to visualize how the total spending vary per state was a simple bar chart. The obvious drawbacks of this versions are the use of single color and the lack of states ordering according to the total amount spent, which makes it hard to compare how the expenditures covary both by state and across regions.\n\n\nPrior version 2\n\n\n\nThe next attempt introduced color for mapping according to regions. My original pallette choice was “BrBG”, which was my esthetic preference. However, its saturated version reveled to be not very color-blindness friendly. Thus, I opted for OkabeIto.\n\n\nPrior version 3\n\n\n\nIn the third version of the bar plot, I added a row to the data frame with the national average value of total spending per student in order to create a bar reflective the the average amount of total spending across the US. I highlighted it in black to make it stand out from the colors for regions. In the end, I made a decision to forgo this way to incorporate the national average for the vertical line. The extra horizontal bar appeared to be less effective: because the plot already has 4 colors it is harder to attend to the extra fifth color compared to the vertical line.\nThis plot also features the addition of yearly spending amount embedded within the visual at the end of each bar. Although this addition is a neat way to demonstrate the gross amounts being spent on a single student, I opted not to include in the final plot. The main goal is relative comparison, so the additional labels on all 50 bar put unnecessary extra weight on the cognitive load. Besides, the break ticks on the x axes in combination with the vertical line, which has a national average amount labeled, make it easy to follow the exact amounts if necessary.\nFinally, in this version I have cleaned up the theme, getting rid of unnecessary grids and the Y-axis title witht he purpose of further balancing off the cognitive load.\n\n\nPrior version 4\n\n\n\nAnd finally, I tried not just color coding the states by the regions, but arranging the state graphs on the plot by region. The result is, though very aesthetically pleasing, not extremely informative. It allows to see the biggest and lowest spenders in each regions, but it makes the relative comparison of states complicated. The patterns within the regions are rather similar: there is a state or two with spendings significantly exceeding the others, but the lowest-spending states in each region end up on approximately the same levels. One advantage of this visualization is the possibility to see how Midwestern states are more homogeneous in relation to each other compared to other regions.\n\n\nCode for the final plot\n\n\ntotal2  %>%\n  ggplot(aes(spend_per_stu_k, fct_reorder(STNAME, spend_per_stu_k))) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = Region),\n           alpha = 0.9) +\n  scale_fill_OkabeIto() + \n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), \n                     limits = c(0, 30),\n                     breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25), \n                     labels = c(\"0\", \"5K\", \"10K\", \"15K\", \"20K\", \"25K\")) + \n  labs(title = \"Total Spending on Education Per Single Student by State\",\n       x = \"Total Yearly Spending Per Student, in USD\",\n       caption = \"Source: National Center for Education Statistics\", \n       fill = \"Region\") + \n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(total2$spend_per_stu_k)), \n             data = total2, \n             linetype = 'dotted',\n             size = 0.8,\n             alpha = 1, \n             color = \"#29211F\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 20)) +\n  annotate(geom = \"label\",\n           x = mean(total2$spend_per_stu_k), \n           y = 10, \n           label = \"US Average = \n$ 12,977\",\n           vjust = .5,\n           color = \"#29211F\",\n           size = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

How do those allocations vary by state?\nDesign choices:\nUsing a color-blind friendly OkabeIto pallette.\nMapping regions to color to add the extra dimension for comparison.\nCreating a vertical bar to show the national average of the total spending per student, which allows to easily see which states’ spending is above and below average.\nBalancing the cognitive load by excluding unnecessary components: the title of the Y-axes, horizontal grids, embedded value of the total spending on each bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpending on Instruction\n\n\n\nFindings\nWhen exploring the data for the spending on instruction per individual student, we see that New York spends the most ($12,693). That exceeds the total instructional spending per student of the two runner-up states, New Jersey with $9,706 and Vermont with $9,555. Such a drastic increase in New York’s spending can be correlated with the average teacher’s salary in that state. All Northeastern state are in the top 15 highest spenders, as is the case with the total spending per student. Interestingly, District of Columbia that spent the most total per student, is only in the 9th place when it comes to instructional expenses only: DC reported $8,194 in average instructional expenses per student. Arizona, Idaho, and Utah spend the least total on Instruction, which is identical to the results of the total expenditure analysis.\n\n\nSpending on Special Education\nThe plot below illustrates the yearly spending on Special Education per state. Due to missing data on the number of students with disabilities in certain states, and on the Special Education spending in other states, the plot presents the gross amount of special education expenditure reported by state, not per single student with special needs.\n\n\n\nFindings\nThis plot is not very informative due to reporting the gross amounts spent, not the amount of spending per student. There are no evident patterns across regions. All the states that are above the national average value (e.g., New York, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey) are the highly populated states, so the increased gross spending is expected. At the same time, the lowest spenders (e.g., District of Columbia, North Dakota, South Dakota) are the least populated territories, so the lowest ranking may not be illustrative of an actual state of events.\nTo make the data a little more comparable, I created the second plot that provides the total spending on Special Education per single student (any student, not student with disabilities).\n\n\n\nThe second plot provides a clearer picture. Consistent with other spending categories, Northeastern states spend the most, and all report the yearly spending above the national average ($6644.68). When normalized for the number of high school student in each state, New Hampshire is the leader in spending on special education, followed by New Jersey and New York. The Western states spend the least on special education, with almost all Western states yielding total spending below national avergae (with the exception of Wyoming and Hawaii). Oregon, Utah, and South Dakota spend the least amount on special education among the states that reported their Special Education Expenditure.\n\n\nSpending on Textbooks\nThe plot below illustrates the yearly spending on textbooks per single student by state.\n\n\n\nFindings\nThe general patterns in textbooks spending diverge a little bit from the patterns we have observed in previous categories. For example, the spendings of Western states are not that low in relation to the rest of the country this time: Western states are divided roughly equally in whether they are above the national average value of $60.01 per student or below. Even though the state that spends the most on books (Pennsylvania) is in Northeast, the states of the region are also equally distributed among the range this time.\n\n\nPrior versions\nAll prior versions of the plots reflecting expenditure on instruction, special education, and textbooks match the ones described in the previous post on the total expenditure. The reasons they were not chosen fot the final rendering are also explained in the previous blog post. The previous versions for the instruction expenditure are provided below for illustrative purposes.\nBar plot with a single color and without ordering of the states according to the amount spent\n\n\n\nBar plot with an introduction of color to map states by regions and ordering of the states according to the amount spent\n\n\n\nBar plot with a vertical line to reflect the national average value on intructional spending and embedding of the state spending value on each bar\n\n\n\n\n\nCode for the final plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

How do those allocations vary by state?\nDesign choices:\nUsing choropleth maps to illustrate the variance in the spending patterns across states.\nChoosing divergent color palette which will allow utilization of two different hues to emphasize the difference between states that report spending above national average value and below: values below average are mapped in cold colors, and values above average - in warm. Mapping lower spending in cold hues and higher spending in warm hues appears to be more intuitive than vice verse.\nSetting up the national average value as a data value that should be mapped to the mid-point of the diverging color scale\nRestricting the overall range of values to allow for more range between the states.\nChoosing a darker outline for the state borders to prevent states in the similar spending category (specifically, Midwestern states) from blurring together.\nBalancing the cognitive load by excluding unnecessary components.\nThe plots below complement the bar plots published in the previous post and reflect the same spending patterns. However, while the bar plots focus on relative ranking, the choropleths put emphasis on the variation patterns, revealing the areas that are more homogeneous in their expenditure amounts, and accentuating any extreme outliers. The mid-point for the scale is set at the average national value, thus, all states mapped in cold colors (blue) spend below the national average, and the states in mapped in warm colors (brown) spend above the national average level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Spending\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe overall range of values has been restricted to exclude District of Columbia: it has the highest total spending per student across all states, significantly exceeding the runner-up state of New York. Including DC in the range would result in assigning it the darkest color which would not be visible on the map due to the small size of the District of Columbia. At the expense of DC, the visualization illustrates the overall variation more distinctly.\n\n\nSpending on Instruction\n\n\n\n\n\nSpending on Special Education\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe states mapped in gray did not have their spending data reported.\n\n\nSpending on Textbooks\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe states mapped in gray did not have their spending data reported.\n\n\nCode for the final plots\n\n\ntotal_map %>% \n  ggplot(aes(geometry = geometry, \n             fill = spend_per_stu_k,\n             color = \"transparent\"), \n         alpha = 0.9) + \n     geom_sf(color = \"#4f4a4a\", size = 0.06) +\n  guides(fill = guide_colorsteps(barwidth = 15,\n                                 barheight = 1,\n                                 title.position = \"top\",\n                                 title.hjust = .5,\n                                 title = \"Total Sending\\n[1000 US$ / Year]\")) +\n\n  scale_fill_scico( palette = 'vik',\n                    midpoint = 13, \n                    breaks = c(8,11,14, 17, 20, 23),\n                                   limits = c(7, 23))+\n  labs(title = \"State total spendings on education per student\",\n       caption = \"Source: National Center for Education Statistics\") +\n  theme_void(20) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .08),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = .17))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings:\nThe regional patterns revealed by the bar plots are easily observable on the maps. With regards to the total spending, the Northeast region is colored in warm brown colors to reflect above the average total spending of all the states in this area. At the same time, West and South are mapped in blue that corresponds to the lower than average spending of the states in those areas. The map is effective in showing that the majority of Midwestern states are very close to the national average level. Compared to the bar plot, the map makes it easier to draw attention to the outliers due to their highly saturated colors, especially when they don’t conform to the general pattern of the region. For example, Wyoming and Alaska that are much higher spenders compared to the rest of the Western states really stand out here.\nThe patterns on the map presenting instructional spending closely align with the patterns of the total spending (highest expenditure in the Northeast, lowest in the West). When looked at side by side, the two maps look almost identical - something that is not easily identifiable on the bar plots due to the emphasis on scaling in the latter.\nThe maps illustrating spending on special education and textbooks are not ideal, because the data on those spending categories was missing from a number of states. Nevertheless, the general patterns are easily noticeable. The highest spenders (Pennsylvania for textbooks and New Hampshire for special education) and the lowest spenders (South Dakota and Utah for special education; Kentucky, Alabama and Hawaii for textbooks) stand out and are easily distinguishable. The map for textbooks reveals the lack of any regional patterns.\nPrior Versions\nThe previous iterations of the map visualization of the expenditure allocation mostly feature utilization of different palettes, since it was my biggest design choice in this part. I am providing the prior versions of the total expenditure visualization to illustrate the design evolution. The prior plots for instructional, special education, and textbook spending featured the same changes in format and design choices.\n\n\n\nPrior Version 1\n\n\n\nThe first version of the map visualization features the viridis inferno palette. I opted not to use this color scheme because it is overly saturated and does not align with the aesthetic in other posts.\n\n\nPrior Version 2\n\n\n\nIn the second attempt, I used a palette with more natural and muted color scheme, bilbao. It lets the states on the higher end of spending stand out and be easily distinguishable. However, I did not like how the lighter browns do not fully reflect the variation in spending in the states that are on the lower spending side.\n\n\nPrior Version 3\n\n\n\nThe third version used the same continuoys scale, bilbao, but with the reversed scale. I tried this version in an atttempt to address the lack of variation created by the original bilbao. I believe, it helps make the variation in the states with lower total spending easily observable (e.g, compared to version 2, it is easier to see that Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma, Tennessi yield the lowest spending amount. AT the same time, the Northeast in lightrer colors, together with Alaska and Wyoming, stand apart. However, I was not complitely satisfied with this version, because mapping higher spend with the lighter color seemed counter-intuitive to me.\nThis version also incorporates some minor refinements, including the position and size of the title, the height of the legend guide, different color of the state outline.\n\n\nPrior Version 4\n\n\n\nNext, I tried to apply the divergent palette, Earth, instead of a continuous scale. The first attempt at using it was not successful, but setting up the national avergae value to the mid-point fixed it. It appears to me, that it is counterintuitive to map highest spending amounts on the colder color, that is why I tried the reverse order of the palette. I was satisfied with the result, upon the whole, however the representation of the variance was still lacking for me with the present colors. The temperature of the colors was there to reflect the difference, but I wanted more saturation as well.\n\n\nPrior Version 5\n\n\n\nVik was the second divergent scale that O tried using. I was very pleased with the division along the average line: cold blue colors for low spending and warm brown colors for high ones. The saturation is not there yet in the current attempt, but I was able to achieve higher saturation range in the final version with restricting the limit and the breaks of the axis. I think the divergent scale is effective in not only depicting the variation and outliers, but also allows a better possibility for relative comparison. The final point in favor of the current palette was the fact hat Vik turned out to be more color-blind friendly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKsenia\nResearch Question:\nDoes increased spending on education in total and on any of the categories (instruction, special education, textbooks) in particular correlate result in better students’ performance? Does cross-state variation in expenditure explain the cross-state variation in education outcomes?\nDesign choices:\nUsing bivariate choropleth maps to illustrate how performance on tests and expenditure covary. The choice was motivated by the fact that bivariate maps tend to show not only how two variables correlate, but where they tend to be in disagreement, which seemed very valuable to me.\nStriving for (relative) simplicity in bivariate maps (e.g., not including decimal points and raw numbers – instead, attempting to emphasize relative rankings).\nSelecting a color palette that is color-blindness friendly and facilitates an easier interpretation.\nChoosing to use 3 dimension to reflect the nuances that might be of interest to policy makers at the Department of Education. Acknowledging, that if the intended audience for this visualization is general public, 2 dimensions might be a better option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Spending\nThe first bivariate map below is showing the combination of the total spending on education per student and the average demonstrated proficiency in Reading and Langguage Arts, while the second one - the relationship between the total spending on education per student and the average demonstrated proficiency in Math.\n\n\n\nFindings:\nWe can see that the increased total spending on a student resulted in increased proficiency test scores, in both math and RLA, in such states Illinois, New York, Maryland, Connecticut, and District of Columbia. In New Hampshire and Ohio, increased total spending correlate with the increased performance on RLA, but with average performance in math, while in North Dakota, above average spending is associated with increased math and average RLA performances. Aligning with this trend are the states such as Arizona, Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi, where the total spend on Education was the lowest relative to other states, and the students demonstrated the lowest scores in both math and RLA. In Florida, lowest relative spending is associated with below average RLA scores and average math performance.\nHowever, this trend is not categorical across all the states. States like Texas, Idaho, Colorado, and Georgia demonstrated relatively high RLA and math scores while they spend less per student. Similarly, Utah reports one of the lowest total spending, but demonstrates above average performance in RLA, and average scores in math, and South Dakota and North Carolina are among the lowest total spenders, but its students perform above average in math and average on RLA. At the same time, Maine exhibits the opposite pattern: the high total spending on Education there negatively correlates with the students’ both RLA and math proficiency. The situation is similar in Rhode Island, where the education spendings are high, but students demonstrate poor math and average RLA scores.\n\n\nSpending on Instruction\nThe first bivariate map below is showing the combination of the total spending on instruction per student and the average demonstrated proficiency in Reading and Language Arts, while the second one - the correlation between the total spending on instruction and the average math scores.\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe states mapped in gray did not have their spending data reported.\nFindings:\nWe can observe the general tendency of positive correlation between Expenditure on Instruction and math and RLA proficiency. In New York, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Connecticut increased spending on instruction results in both increased math and RLA scores. Similarly, increased spending in Nebraska and Pennsylvania correlates with increased math proficiency and average RLA scores, and in New Hampshire - with average math and increased RLA performance. Arizona, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Tennessee, Mississippi, report the lowest total spend on Instruction, which correlates with the relatively low demonstrated proficiency in both math and RLA by students of those states.\nInterestingly, Texas, Colorado and Idaho that demonstrated the high RLA and math scores despite small total spending, exhibit the same pattern here: high math scores and high RLA scores despite low spending on Instruction. The experience of those states should be looked into in more detail to try to figure out what exactly is done differently in those states to have such amazing results. On the flip side, Maine again exhibits the opposite pattern: the high instructional spending negatively correlates with the students’ math and RLA proficiency. Here (i.e., when accounting for instructional spending only), the same trend is observed in Minnesota and Hawaii with regards to both math and RLA scores.\n\n\nSpending on Special Education\nThe first bivariate map below is showing the combination of the total spending on special education per student and the average demonstrated proficiency of students with disabilities in Reading and Language Arts, while the second one - the correlation between the total spending on special education and the average math scores of students with disabilities.\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe states mapped in gray did not have their spending data reported.\nFindings:\nThe two plots compare the spending and the performance of only students with disabilities, so there it no need to compare with previous plots. The most interesting observation, in my opinion, is that there are no states that report higher than average spending on students with disabilities but where students demonstrate poor performance in math, and there is only one state, Vermont, that is among the higher spenders on special education but that also reports below average performance in RLA. It gives us ground to say, that increased spending on special education is never wasted and very often results in improved performance.\nThe second interesting observation, is that there are a lot more states that show correlation between increased spending on Special Ed and above average performance in math (e.g., New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Michigan. etc.), compared to the results of students with disabilities in RLA, and to results of analysis of other categories. This suggests that increased spending on special education boosts math performance of students with disabilities in particular.\n\n\nSpending on Textbooks\nThe first bivariate map below is showing the combination of the total spending on textbooks per student and the average demonstrated proficiency in Reading and Language Arts, while the second one - the correlation between the total spending on textbooks and the average math scores.\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe states mapped in gray did not have their spending data reported.\nFindings:\nThe most interesting observation, in my opinion, is that there are states (e.g., Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, etc.)who were among “low spenders but high performers” in the previous analysis, but the increased spending on textbooks actually directly correlates with improved performance in both RLA and Math. It might suggests, that when everything else is controlled for, increased spending on textbooks might be that deciding factor that determines students performance. If that is indeed the case, it is very empowering, given how small the expenditure on textbook is compared to instruction, for example. no states that report higher than average spending on students with disabilities but where students demonstrate poor performance in math, and there is only one state, Vermont, that is among the higher spenders on special education but that also reports below average performance in RLA. It gives us ground to say, that increased spending on special education is never wasted and very often results in improved performance.\nThe second interesting observation, is that there are a lot more states that show correlation between increased spending on textbooks and above average performance in math (e.g., New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Michigan. etc.), compared to RLA scores. This matches the similar trend in Special education funding, where increase in spending affects performance in math more significantly compared to RLA. This may suggest that math performance might be more susceptible to changes in expenditure and depend on it to a certain extent, while performance on RLA is primarily determined by other factors, unrelated to expenditure.\n\n\nCode for the final plot\n\n\n#Plotting bivariate map to express relations between RLA score and total spending\nbiscale2 <- \n  scores_instruction %>% \n  group_by(STNAME) %>% \n  summarize(\n    rla = mean(mean_rla_all, na.rm=TRUE),\n    instr = mean(instr_per_stu_k, na.rm=TRUE)\n  ) %>% \n  bi_class(x = rla, y = instr, style = \"quantile\", dim = 3)\n\n\nnames(biscale2)[1]<-\"full\"\nmap_join2<- biscale2%>%left_join(statepop, by= \"full\") \n\n\n\np3<-plot_usmap(data = map_join2, values = \"bi_class\", labels = TRUE, label_color = \"black\")   +\n  bi_scale_fill(pal = \"DkCyan\", dim = 3, guide = F) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL) + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(margin = margin(b = 8), \n                              color = \"#ffffff\",face = \"bold\",size = 9,\n                              hjust = 0.5,\n                              family = \"Arial\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(t=10,b = 25), \n                                 color = \"#ffffff\", size = 6, family = \"Arial\",\n                                 hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.caption =  element_text(margin = margin(t = 20), \n                                 color = \"#ffffff\", size = 5, family = \"Arial\",\n                                 hjust = 0.95),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    legend.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x    = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y    = element_blank(),\n    panel.background = element_blank(), \n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), \n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f3f3f3\", color = NA),\n    panel.border = element_blank(),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 1, 1), \"cm\"),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n\np3$layers[[2]]$aes_params$size <- 2.5\n\nlegend_US3<- \n  bi_legend(pal = \"DkCyan\",\n            dim = 3,\n            xlab = \"Proficiency in RLA\",\n            ylab = \"Instructional Spend\",\n            size = 30) +\n  theme(rect = element_rect(fill = \"grey10\"),\n        panel.border = element_blank(),\n        axis.text = element_blank(),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f3f3f3\", color = NA),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12,\n                                    color = \"grey20\",\n                                    face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12,\n                                    color = \"grey20\",\n                                    face = \"bold\"),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 5),\n        legend.text.align = 0)\n\n\nggdraw() +\n  draw_plot(p3, 0, 0, 1, 1) +\n  draw_plot(legend_US3, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) +\n  draw_label(\"Source:National Center for Education Statistics)\", \n             color = \"#a1a1a1\", size = 7.5, angle = 0, x = 0.9, y = 0.05) +\n  draw_label(\"In which states the total spending on Instruction per student positively affects performance in RLA?\", \n             color = \"#000000\", size = 15, angle = 0, x =0.5, y = 0.97, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f3f3f3\", color = NA)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Findings:\nPerformance in math is suggested to be affected by changes in spending patterns more than RLA scores, that are most likely determined by other factors unrelated to funding\nSpending on textbooks appears to have the biggest contribution to the student performance compared by other categories.\nWhile they are states where direct correlation patterns between spending and test scores are found, there are states (e.g., Texas, Idaho, Utah, Colorado)that report lower than average spending but better overall performance. It is suggested that those states’ increased allocation on textbook may be the deciding factor. However, it is still crucial to study their experience in more detail to determine what are other factors that might positively affect test scores without spending increase\nAt the same time, the examples of states where the increased spending correlates with poor performance are very rare in all categories. That suggests that increased expenditure will very rarely have a negative effect on students’ performance.\nPrior Versions\n\n\n\nPrior Version 1\n\n\n\nThe first version of the bivariate map visualization features lables of states in default sizing, that I ended up changing, specifically to have the Northeast region look neater. The labels were also in white color, while I opted for black. This plot also shows the original versions of the legend, title and subtitle, which I cleaned up in the final version.\n\n\nPrior Version 2\n\n\n\nThis plot utilizes 2 dimensions to represent two variables instead of 3. I opted to have 3 dimensions to show more nuanced details, which should be of interest to policy makers (my intended audience). However, since we are interested in the extremes anyway (groups like ‘highest spending-poor performance’, ‘highest spending-best performance’), they are visible in the 2-dimensional map anyway. And even though with the expense of certain nuances, the 2-dimensional version is easier to interpret. Thus, even though I chose to use a 3-dimensional scale, I would recommend to use a 2-dimensional one if presented to the general public.\n\n\nPrior Version 3\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to find the optimal palette that would make the interpretation of a 3-dimensional bivariate plot easier, I tried several other palettes. Here is the version with DkBlue palette, which ended being not color-blind friendly.\n\n\nPrior Version 4\n\n\n\nThis version is rendered with the use of DkViolet palette. Unlike DkBlue it was suitable for all types of color-blindness, but I made a decision to not use because it is too close to those palettes used for political outcomes in the US for my liking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
